# Description

LemonTizer is a class that wraps the [spacy](https://spacy.io) library to build a lemmatizer for language learning applications. It automatically manages the installation and loading of all [languages](https://spacy.io/models) supported by spacy and provides various lemmatizations options.

It is designed so that lemmatization can be enabled for multiple languages with the same amount of effort as enabling it for one, thus making community made scripts more widely accessible.

`lemon_tizer.py` is fully documented to make it easier to make changes.

(for those curious, lemon tizer is a pun on the [Scottish soft drink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tizer) which comes in various fruit flavours)

# Quickstart

First, install spacy using pip:

```bash
pip install spacy
```

Example of lemmatizing a single sentence:

```python
# Import class
from lemon_tizer import LemonTizer

# Initialise class
# Language should be a lower case 2 letter code, see "Supported Languages" table for list of abbreviations
# Model size depends on availability of models, see https://spacy.io/models
# Normally, these are "sm", "md", "lg"
# Larger models are more accurate and support more features but require more storage space and may take longer to run
lemma = LemonTizer(language="en", model_size= "lg")

# Lemmatize a test string and print the result
test_string = "I am going to the shops to buy a can of Tizer."
output = lemma.lemmatize_sentence(test_string)
print(output)
```

This would produce the following output:

```python
"""
Output:
[{'I': 'I'},
 {'am': 'be'},
 {'going': 'go'},
 {'to': 'to'},
 {'the': 'the'},
 {'shops': 'shop'},
 {'to': 'to'},
 {'buy': 'buy'},
 {'a': 'a'},
 {'can': 'can'},
 {'of': 'of'},
 {'Tizer': 'Tizer'},
 {'.': '.'}]
"""
```

# Script settings

You can also enable various settings to exclude punctuation, exclude common words, force the input to lower case to change the behaviour, etc. A use case of this would be creating a frequency analysis of calculating the words in a text.

Example:

```python
# Import class
from lemon_tizer import LemonTizer

# Initialise class
lemma = LemonTizer(language="en", model_size= "lg")

# Configure settings
lemma.set_lemma_settings(filter_out_non_alpha=True,
    filter_out_common=True,
    convert_input_to_lower=True,
    convert_output_to_lower=True,
    return_just_first_word_of_lemma=True
)

# Lemmatize a test string and print the result
test_string = "I am going to the shops to buy a can of Tizer."
output = lemma.lemmatize_sentence(test_string)
print(output)
```

This would produce the following output:

```python
"""
Output:
[{'going': 'go'}, {'shops': 'shop'}, {'buy': 'buy'}, {'tizer': 'tizer'}]
"""
```

The options are:

| Boolean Variable                | Explanation                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| filter_out_non_alpha            | Will filter out lemmatizations that contain non-alpha characters. Useful for removing punctuation, etc. Note: lemmatizations with an apostrophe will also be filtered if this is set! |
| filter_out_common               | Will filter out common words such as "the, and, she". Useful when doing frequency analysis.                                                                                           |
| convert_input_to_lower          | Forces the input string to lowercase. May be useful to increase accuracy in some languages.                                                                                           |
| convert_output_to_lower         | Forces the lemmatization to be lower case to change the behaviour of the algorithm, particularly in relation to the identification of proper nouns.                                   |
| return_just_first_word_of_lemma | Some lemmatizations will return multiple words for a given input token. Setting this to True will return just the first word.                                                         |

# Advanced Functions

You can call `LemonTizer.get_spacy_object()` to get the underlying spacy object which has been initialised to a given model, should you wish to use functions not exposed by the wrapper.
